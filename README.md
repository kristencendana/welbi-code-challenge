Hello! Welcome to my Welbi Code Challenge!

In this challenge, I use TypeScript, React, Node, Sass, and Material-Ui to create a front-end path sending various REST API Get/Post Requests.

I have hidden my bearer token so it will need to be replaced in the contexts/DataContext.tsx file. 

For instructions on how to visualize the application, we have 4 pages:
- Programs Page
- Program Info Page
- Residents Page
- Residents Info Page

I manage my state with useContext in DataContext.tsx file.

Further components include Dialogs and Tables for specific pages.

If given more time, I would finish adding the forms components as it is currently incomplete, (but not in MVP scope).

Dummy Data is being created for the project for demo purposes only.

To start, run the command 'npm run build' then 'npm start' OR 'npm run dev'!

I hope you enjoy my application. :)
